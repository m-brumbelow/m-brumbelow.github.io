This post is a walthrough of challenges from the 2024 Magnet Virtual Summit CTF.

## Background
The 2024 Magnet Virtual Summit CTF, powered by Hexordia, took place on March 6th, 2024. I placed first this year! Congrats to my fellow winners, dumbo (2nd place) and Cognitor4n6 (3rd place). First to finish was INSERT HERE

I had the honor of helping create the 2021 MVS CTF, just participating in 2022, and placing third in 2023. Since the mighty stark4n6 did not participate this year, I thought I would post a walkthrough of how I got flags. I also did not get to finish the CTF during the time alloted, so this gives me an opportunity to go through all the challenges as well.

The following post details on how I personally got the flags. Any flags I got during the CTF alloted time will be marked with a *. Remember, there are tons of ways to get to an answer in a Capture the Flag competition, and this post will not detail all of those, just how I got them.

 AXIOM v7.10.1.39284
 iLEAPP v1.18.10
 aLEAPP v3.1.10
 DB Browser for SQLite
 exiftool v12.78

## iOS
All flags were found using the 00008110-000925383620A01E_files_full.zip image, for this section.

The following flags were not found (yet) for iOS and will be updated when they are:
- [ ] Its been a long time
- [ ] The devil is in the details

### Why are your messages green? (5 points*)
> 'On what date did Rocco and Chadwick first meet in person according to their conversations? YYYY-MM-DD format'

The challenge is asking for a date based on conversations. Based on the title, this will most likely lie within the iOS message artifacts. Using AXIOM, I navigated to the "COMMUNICATION" section, and selected "iOS iMessage/SMS/MMS". Within this section, I quickly scanned through conversations until I found one with Rocco. From the VeraKey report, we know the owner of the phone is named "Chadwick Elms", so this conversation will be from the device to Rocco.

The only time Rocco and Chadwick messaged about meeting in person was on 12/17/2023. As seen in Figure 1.1, this message can be found at the filesystem location '\private\var\mobile\mobile\Library\SMS\sms.db'.
Message 10 asks when the earliest that they can meet up. Based on other messages in the same message chain, the meetup did happen that same day. 12/17/2023 just needs to be formatted to YYYY-MM-DD, and that is the flag.

Flag
: 2023-12-17

### Where /r u going on safari? (5 points*)
> What subreddit was visited in a browser?

In the question, safari is mentioned, pointing us in the direction of Safari artifacts. Since all reddit URLs include the word "reddit", I did a keyword search in AXIOM, and then looked at the "WEB REALTED" section, and selected "Safari History". Reddit URLs denote the subreddit page after the "/r". As seen in Figure 1.2, all results for the keyword search "reddit" on Safari history included "/r/Twitch", meaning the subreddit visted was the Twitch subreddit.
![Figure1.2](Figure1.2.png){: .shadow width="700" height="400"}

Flag
: Twitch

### IMAGEine living in pain (5 points*)
> Chad seemed to be searching for pain relief medicine in a store, how much did it cost?

This one took me a hot sec, as I jumped right into keyword searches before actually paying attention to the question itself. IMAGE is capitalized, hinting that the flag will be found in a photo. Under the "MEDIA" section in AXIOM, I looked under the "Photos Media Information" tab.
I looked here instead of "Pictures" as it just includes information for pictures and videos found within the native iOS "Photos" application, making it more likely the user took these photos.
I scrolled through until I found "IMG_0017.HEIC". The photo, found at the file system path "\private\var\mobile\Media\PhotoData\Thumbnails\V2\DCIM\100APPLE\IMG_0017.HEIC", was a picture of pain relief gel, along with a price tag, as seen in Figure 1.3.

![Figure1.3](Figure1.3.png){: .shadow width="700" height="400"}

Flag
: 10.99

### Your keyboard is salt-y (5 points)
> How many total words were typed on the device?

I am suprised I could not get this flag during the CTF time, as it was only 5 points (and those tend to be easier). I had quickly done some research on where this information is stored on iOS, but could not find the flag during the alloted 3 hours.
I had the right article, but the heat of battle did not get me to the right database in time. BUT the smoke has settled, and the flag can be found at the path: "private\var\mobile\Library\Keyboard\user_model_database.sqlite", in the table "usermodeldurablerecords".
In that table, the key "tium.totalWordsTyped" holds the flag value, as seen in Figure 1.4. I used AXIOM's native SQLITE Viewer for this, but any SQLite viewer could be used.

![Figure1.4](Figure1.4.png){: .shadow width="700" height="400"}

The information on artifact location was found via the blog Salt4n6 <https://salt4n6.com/category/mobile-forensics/>.

### Don't ghost me (5 points*) 6
>At what time did Chadwick get annoyed at MYAI? YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC

MYAI is a feature of Snapchat. Since I know this, I will go directly to Snapchat artifacts in AXIOM, but a quick keyword search of "myai" would get you there as well. In the conversations between Chadwick and MYAI, MYAI apologies for annoyed Chadwick. The message before that is "I thought u were cool with the Avs but now you're getting on my nerves", sent at 12/26/2023 11:27:45.256 PM UTC, as seen in Figure 1.6. 

The format of that date to the flag format is 2023-12-26 23:27:45 UTC. 
																																																											
Flag
: 2023-12-26 23:27:45


### Build me up, buttercup (5 points*) 7 
>What is the current build version?

The artifact containing information on build version can be found at the location "\private\var\installd\Library\MobileInstallation\LastBuildInfo.plist". This information  is nicely parsed out by iLEAPP, under the IOS BUILD section, as seen in Figure 1.7, and is Build 20F75. 

Flag
: 20F75

### Warning Signs (5 points*) 8 
>How many days did it take Chad to be warned about his Data Usage?

Data usage warnings normally come through notifications or text messages. In AXIOM, I went to the "COMMUNICATION" section, and the iOS "iMessage/SMS/MMS" subsection. I then ordered the dates from oldest to newest. Messages welcoming Chadwick to Boost mobile were first received on 11/29/2023. On 12/17/2023, the first message warning about data is received, as seen in Figure 1.8. This is 18 days since the plan started. 

Text message artifacts are logged at the location "\private\var\mobile\Library\SMS\sms.db". 

Flag
: 18

### Watching streams to stay current (10 points) 9
> What is the name of Chad's streaming channel?

Normally, gamers either stream on Twitch or Youtube. Gamers also often use Discord. I first tried keyword searching for Twitch, and did not find much. I then looked through Discord Messages under "COMMUNICATION". When scrolling through, I noticed a few messages that mentioned streaming.
I also found a message with a Youtube link in it. I did not see any other youtube links, so I copied the link found, seen in Figure 1.9.1, into a web browser ("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzfqVQWnf7s"). As seen in Figure 1.9.2, this a streaming video posted by ChadwickGames. 

Flag 
: ChadwickGames
		
### What question did Chadwick ask to AI? (10 points*) 10
>What question did Chadwick ask to AI?

After attempting to put every question that Chad asked myAI on Snapchat, I knew there must be another AI service used on the phone. The most popular AI at the time is ChatGPT, made by OpenAI. Searching for "ChatGPT" in AXIOM came with no relevant results, other than confirming that the ChatGPT app was installed on the phone. The package name is "com.openai.chat", so I attempted to search for "openai" next. 

In these results, I could see that there were 10 iOS Snapshots taken within the application "com.openai.chat", under the Media section. Two of those snapshots include the same content, of the question "How to make online friends" being asked, as seen in Figure 1.10. 
	
Flag
: How to make online friends	


### Watch me sUAVely win this game (10 points*) 11
>How many kills did Chad have on his CoD Mobile winning game?
A winning match was most likely being recorded by Chad, who was trying to get into streaming. Under the "MEDIA" section in AXIOM, I first looked under "Photos Media Information". I went through the videos found here, and found a few recorded of the COD (Call of Duty) mobile app. 
Scores for COD games tend to be shown at the end, so I skipped to the end of the video where "WINNER" was shown, and went back about 30 seconds. A few matches recorded were winners, but there was one I found ("IMG_0041.MOV") that had Chad making the final kill, bringing his score up to "7". 
This video matches the one posted to Youtube by Chad, the same mentioned in "Watching streams to stay current". As seen in Figure 1.11, this video shows the score by Chad at 1:17 seconds. Starting here probably would have been easier....
	
Flag
: 7

### For when I cant Find My gear (10 points) 12
> What outdoor activity store did Chadwick Visit?
		
I really thought this answer lay in the photos and maps locations on the devices, which mentioned the store 'Christy Sports' many times. Again, I missed a challenge name clue. Find My is so obviously capitalized, I am not sure how I missed it the first time around. 
Regardless, the hint points in the direction of Find My artifacts, shown under the "CONNECTED DEVICES" section in AXIOM. Under "Find My Devices", there is one entry that has an address associated with it. That address is 613 S Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305, as seen in Figure 12.1. 
A quick google search led me to Maps, which showed the store "Neptune Mountaineering" as at this address. 
		
Flag
: Neptune Mountaineering
		
### Just a couple steps away (10 points*) 13
>How many steps did Chad take on 12/3/2023?

In iLEAPP, I went to the "HEALTH" section, and subsection "Heath - Steps". I filtered to "2023-12-03" by searching that date, where there were 4 entries, as seen in Figure 1.13. I added up all the entries (272 + 299 + 175 + 222) to get a total step count of 968. 


Flag
: 968

	
### Another regularly scheduled program (10 points) 14
>What Tattoo shop was visited on 12/27/2023?

In AXIOM, I looked at the "LOCATION & TRAVEL" section, all artifacts. I filtered on the "Accessed Date/Time -UTC" column for 12/27/2023. I then went to World Map view, and zoomed in on the greatest concentration of results. These results were concentrated in Boulder, CO, USA, specifically on the road "South Broadway", as seen in Figure 1.14.1. 

I then opened Google Maps and searched for "s broadway boulder co". I zoomed out a bit to get a better view, and then searched "tattoo" in that area. The only tattoo shop that showed up on Broadway was "Auspicious Tattoo", as seen in Figure 1.14.2. 
and then the "cached locations" subsection. 
Cached locations, map, s brodway boulder, tattoo

### I hear Stanley cups are all the rage (25 points*) 15

Flag
: 6-4

### Exuse Moi? What did you say? (25 points*) 16
>What is the content of the 2nd message that Chad deleted on Dec 18, 2023

This one stumped me for awhile on the day of the CTF. I knew iOS 16 had the feature to unsend/delete messages, and that for 30 days, those still show up in the messages database as being deleted. On the iOS image, I found where two messages were marked as being deleted in the "\private\var\mobile\Library\SMS\sms.db" file, but I could not find the content for them (Figure 1.16.1)! The deleted date was "724790253201282944" and I took note of that. There were also two handle_ids, 5 and 35. In the table "chat_handle_join", it is shown that "chat_id" and "handle_id" match for values shown (Figure 1.16.2). 
	
As the second message deleted was to Rocco, I decided to look on the Android image for evidence, since unsent/deleted messages only work between iOS 16 devices. I sorted by Received Date/Time, and looked at messages on 12/18/2023. There were three messages that do not match values found in the "message" table in the iOS "sms.db" file, matching the chat_id 5.

These were:
"Let's meet there at 9pm in 26min"
"Excuse me?! That's quite a bold statement considering I'm the one who walked away with a black eye and spent $30 last night on products to avoid one!"
"I'll even throw in a third one for free just for you"

The second message on 12/18/2023 is the flag.

: Excuse me?! That's quite a bold statement considering I'm the one who walked away with a black eye and spent $30 last night on products to avoid one!


### Its been a long time (25 points) 17
> When did chad last login to Facebook? YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC

I was not able to complete this challenge yet.  

### Can anyone Kelp? (25 points*) 18
>What game was Chad asking to know the strategy to?

Chad liked gaming - any game. At first this was hard to narrow down, as I did not see any results for "strategy" or the like for keyword searches in AXIOM. Since I knew Chad had a facebook, I just looked up his profile. There, he had made a post about the strategy to Terrarium, as seen in Figure 1.18.

Flag

>Whose bitmoji is dressed like a devil?
	
UNKNOWN

### The easy way or the hard way (25 points*) 20
>What is the timestamp of the message Chad sent to Rocco but was never recieved? YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC

Very similar to the method of "Exuse Moi? What did you say?", I compared the messages on each phone to find this flag. The one message that existed on the iOS device and not the Android was "You're right there's no easy way out. I'll forgive and forget if you help me get better at games... not just CoD. Do we have a deal?", sent at 12/21/2023 6:29:36.000 AM UTC, as seen in Figure 1.20.
