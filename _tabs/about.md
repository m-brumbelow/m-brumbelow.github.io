### Madi Brumbelow
Driven by a lifelong passion for technology and a natural curiosity about how things work, I've transformed my enthusiasm into a career and volunteer work aimed at leveraging technology to benefit others. My journey is not just about understanding technology but harnessing its power to make a positive impact on the world. Whether investigating digital footprints in the corporate realm or empowering students through refurbished technology, I am committed to making a positive impact through the field of digital forensics.
